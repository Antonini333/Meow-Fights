# FightGame

This is a basic project made out of HTML5, CSS3 and ECMAScript6.

Just interact between the 3 pages, choose players and use them in the Battle Page with the ATTACK button.

And error must be fixed, since the second player never hits, it just
still on receiving attacks and attacks..Sorry for that in advance. :D
